# MarkupUK 2023 - TDD with XSLT

This repo contains materials from my talk at MarkupUK 2023 :
**Using TDD to produce High Quality XSLT**.

You'll find the slides, and each step of the live coding is
described as Git commits, with explanations.

I hope you'll find everthing you need, and if not, just
